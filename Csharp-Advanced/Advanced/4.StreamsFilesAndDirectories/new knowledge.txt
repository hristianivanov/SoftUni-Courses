Streams are ordered sequences of bytes
Operations: open  read / write  close
Always close streams with try-finally or using(…)
Use StreamReader / StreamWriter for text data
Use FileStream to read / write binary files
Use the File class to read / write files at once
Use the Directory class to work with directories
