Superclass - Parent/Base class 
The class giving its members to its child class

Subclass - Child/Derived class
The class taking members from its base class

Constructors are not inherited
They can be reused by the child classes with keyword "base"

In C# there is no multiple inheritance
Only multiple interfaces can be implemented

Virtual - defines a method that can be overriden in child class

The sealed modifier prevents other classes from inheriting from it
You can use the sealed modifier on a method,property in a base class.


Composition (HAS-A relation)
- using classes to define classes


Composition (IS-A relation)
- inheriting class

All classes in C# inherit the Object class and therefore 
have all its public members :
-ToString() 
-Equals()
-GetHashCode()
-ToString()
