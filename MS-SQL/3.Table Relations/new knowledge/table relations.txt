alias 'AS'

directive and transitive dependency

guid (globally unique identifier)

primary key by default is not null and unique
Composite PK -> { PK1, PK2}

sql script

Each table in db can be called entity

foreign keys can have null/not null constraint but depends on the situation

Mapping table - connects PKs from tables, usually this is for many-to-many table relation.
It had composit PK (first_table_PK, second_table_PK) // UNIQUE, NOT NULL
It has the primary keys from other tables but for its the keys are foreign.
At least the mapping table had 2 FK.
Mapping table is way to create relation between the tables

The idea of creating table is not to make redundancies

E/R Diagram (Entity Relation Diagram)

The difference between LEFT/RIGHT JOIN and only JOIN is that JOIN doesn't display 
the results of search by the condition we want which had any information in some column -> null

You have to use ALIAS when you had duplicate names from tables' column

SET IDENTITY_INSERT [ [ database_name . ] schema_name . ] table_name { ON | OFF } 

datetime2 vs datetime - the difference is that datetime data type had more precision especially in time hh:mm:ss:[.n] // up to 7
