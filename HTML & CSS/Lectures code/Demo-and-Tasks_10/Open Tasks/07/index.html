                    <p>Tim had written the three fundamental technologies that remain the foundation of today’s web (and which you may have seen appear on parts of your web browser):</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML: HyperText Markup Language. The markup (formatting) language for the web.</li>
                        <li>URI: Uniform Resource Identifier. A kind of “address” that is unique and used to identify to each resource on the web. It is also commonly called a URL.</li>
                        <li>HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Allows for the retrieval of linked resources from across the web.</li>
